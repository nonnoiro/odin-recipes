        <h2>Dish Origin</h2>
        <p>In June 1889 the pizzaiolo <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffaele_Esposito" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Raffaele Esposito</a></em>, Pizzeria Brandi's chef, invented a dish called "pizza Margherita" in honor of the Queen of Italy,<br>
        <em>Margherita</em> of Savoy, and Italian unification, since toppings are tomato (red), mozzarella (white), and basil (green), ingredients inspired by the<br>
        colors of the national flag of Italy.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

          <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
            <div style="white-space: pre;"><li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each<br>addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place<br>(80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form<br>each into a ball.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of<br>tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce,<br>then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.</li>
            <li>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to<br>7 minutes.</li>
           
        </ol>
        </div>

    <h1>CLASSIC BURGER</h1>

    <img src="../images/burger.jpg" alt="Picture of a beef burger" style="height: 600px; width: 1000px;">

    <h2>Dish Origin</h2>
    <p>In Wisconsin, many claim the burger was invented by <em>Charlie Nagreen</em>, who purportedly sold a meatball between two slices of bread at an 1885 fair in<br>Seymour.
      Shortly after its creation, the hamburger quickly included all of its currently typically characteristic trimmings, including onions, lettuce,<br>and sliced pickles.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <div style="white-space: pre;"><li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
      <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
      <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
      <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
      <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center<br>should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
